### Who the course is for

Are you doing any of these things below:
- You write scripts to process data.
- You change scripts written by your colleagues.
- You write code that is used in research by you or others.

If yes, then this course is for you.  This is not designed for
"professional code developers" or computer scientists.

If you develop research code and you know all the tools
already, **join us as a helper!** It's fun, and you always learn
something new about a subject by teaching it.


### How to join

We are normally limited by number of helpers, thus *why not allow
groups to bring their own helper?*:

- We have the concept of **teams** that **bring their own breakout room**.
- Anyone may **register as a learner**, we will try to take as many as we can.
- Or you can **register as a helper**.  If you are somewhat comfortable
  with these tools, you can be a helper! (see below)
- **Register as a team**, one helper and 4-6 learners.
  - We will accept all complete teams.
  - Everyone on the team must register separately.
  - Decide some team name, and when registering, everone enter this
    same name so that we can link you together.
  - During the exercise sessions in breakout rooms, the helper has
    primary responsibility for their group's hands-on exercises.
    Still, instructors drop by to check and help
    as needed, so don't worry if you don't know everything.
  - This is a great opportunity to bring your friends and colleagues
    and prepare for the future together.

If you've been to a CodeRefinery before and have used git some after
that, you are definitely capable of being a helper.  If you routinely
use git and know Python somewhat well, you are also very qualified to
be a helper.

We arrange a helper onboarding sessions (see under Schedule). It is strongly recommended for the first-time helpers to attend this onboarding session. Please join one of the following sessions that fits your schedule.


### What we will not teach

This is not a course about a specific programming language or
the Linux/Unix terminal shell.  We assume that you are familiar with the programming
language that you use in your work and research.  We try to keep the course as
language-independent as possible but we will show some basic code examples in
Python.

### FAQ

- **Why should I come as a team?**  If you will work together later,
  learning the tools at the same time is a great way to do it.

- **Am I good enough to be a helper?**  If you are asking this
  question, probably you are.  You should have some familiarity with
  git, provide some initial advice on obvious error messages, and
  be able to call us for advanced help when it's needed.

- **How does the waiting list work?**  Anyone can register, but you go to
  the waitlist until we can be sure we have enough helpers.  We'll
  continually approve people as we get space.  We know
  this may be more unpredictable for you, but the way to make sure you
  get in is join a team with a helper (or find us more helpers in
  general). 

- **If it's online, why did you close?**  CodeRefinery workshops are
  interactive, with lots of interaction between instructors, helpers,
  and learners.  We can scale one-to-many easily, but we reached the
  limits of an interactive format.

- **How can I be notified of updates?**  Currently, we don't have any
  way.  Follow [@coderefine](https://twitter.com/coderefine) on
  Twitter.
